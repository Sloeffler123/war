The player with the highest value (2 being the lowest and ace being the highest) wins and takes all cards and places them on the bottom of the deck. If both players play reveal the same card a war happens. Each player will place three cards from the top of the deck face down and one face up. The player with the highest value wins all cards. If the players reveal the same card repeat the process. If a player runs out of cards during a war the last card they have will be there face up card. The player with all the cards at the end wins.''')
